# How to contribute

If you want to contribute to this project and make it better, your help is very welcome. Contributing is a great way for me to learn from other developers! 

## How to make a clean pull request 

* Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
* Clone the fork on your local machine.
* Create a new branch to work on! Branch from `develop` if it exists, else from master.
* Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
* Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
* Add or change the documentation as needed.
* Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote `origin`.
* From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's `develop` branch if there is one, else go for master!
* Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es).

And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code â€“ not what you did to the code.
